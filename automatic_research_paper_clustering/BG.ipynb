       "  'abstract': 'the ability of a p2p network to scale its throughput up in proportion to the arrival rate of peers has recently been shown to be crucially dependent on the chunk sharing policy employed. some policies can result in low frequencies of a particular chunk, known as the missing chunk syndrome, which can dramatically reduce throughput and lead to instability of the system. for instance, commonly used policies that nominally \"boost\" the sharing of infrequent chunks such as the well known rarest-first algorithm have been shown to be unstable. recent efforts have largely focused on the careful design of boosting policies to mitigate this issue. we take a complementary viewpoint, and instead consider a policy that simply prevents the sharing of the most frequent chunk(s). following terminology from statistics wherein the most frequent value in a data set is called the mode, we refer to this policy as mode-suppression. we also consider a more general version that suppresses the mode only if the mode frequency is larger than the lowest frequency by a fixed threshold. we prove the stability of mode-suppression using lyapunov techniques, and use a kingman bound argument to show that the total download time does not increase with peer arrival rate. we then design versions of mode-suppression that sample a small number of peers at each time, and construct noisy mode estimates by aggregating these samples over time. we show numerically that the variants of mode-suppression yield near-optimal download times, and outperform all other recently proposed chunk sharing algorithms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we propose an r package, called rkhsmetamod, that implements a procedure for estimating a meta-model of a complex model. the meta-model approximates the hoeffding decomposition of the complex model and allows us to perform sensitivity analysis on it. it belongs to a reproducing kernel hilbert space that is constructed as a direct sum of hilbert spaces. the estimator of the meta-model is the solution of a penalized empirical least-squares minimization with the sum of the hilbert norm and the empirical l^2-norm. this procedure, called rkhs ridge group sparse, allows both to select and estimate the terms in the hoeffding decomposition, and therefore, to select and estimate the sobol indices that are non-zero. the rkhsmetamod package provides an interface from r statistical computing environment to the c++ libraries eigen and gsl. in order to speed up the execution time and optimize the storage memory, except for a function that is written in r, all of the functions of this package are written using the efficient c++ libraries through rcppeigen and rcppgsl packages. these functions are then interfaced in the r environment in order to propose a user-friendly package.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'reaction networks are often used to model interacting species in fields such as biochemistry and ecology. when the counts of the species are sufficiently large, the dynamics of their concentrations are typically modeled via a system of differential equations. however, when the counts of some species are small, the dynamics of the counts are typically modeled stochastically via a discrete state, continuous time markov chain.   a key quantity of interest for such models is the probability mass function of the process at some fixed time. since paths of such models are relatively straightforward to simulate, we can estimate the probabilities by constructing an empirical distribution. however, the support of the distribution is often diffuse across a high-dimensional state space, where the dimension is equal to the number of species. therefore generating an accurate empirical distribution can come with a large computational cost.   we present a new monte carlo estimator that fundamentally improves on the \"classical\" monte carlo estimator described above. it also preserves much of classical monte carlo\\'s simplicity. the idea is basically one of conditional monte carlo. our conditional monte carlo estimator has two parameters, and their choice critically affects the performance of the algorithm. hence, a key contribution of the present work is that we demonstrate how to approximate optimal values for these parameters in an efficient manner. moreover, we provide a central limit theorem for our estimator, which leads to approximate confidence intervals for its error.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this work, we introduce a new and efficient solution approach for the problem of decision making under uncertainty, which can be formulated as decision making in a belief space, over a possibly high-dimensional state space. typically, to solve a decision problem, one should identify the optimal action from a set of candidates, according to some objective. we claim that one can often generate and solve an analogous yet simplified decision problem, which can be solved more efficiently. a wise simplification method can lead to the same action selection, or one for which the maximal loss in optimality can be guaranteed. furthermore, such simplification is separated from the state inference, and does not compromise its accuracy, as the selected action would finally be applied on the original state. first, we present the concept for general decision problems, and provide a theoretical framework for a coherent formulation of the approach. we then practically apply these ideas to decision problems in the belief space, which can be simplified by considering a sparse approximation of their initial belief. the scalable belief sparsification algorithm we provide is able to yield solutions which are guaranteed to be consistent with the original problem. we demonstrate the benefits of the approach in the solution of a realistic active-slam problem, and manage to significantly reduce computation time, with no loss in the quality of solution. this work is both fundamental and practical, and holds numerous possible extensions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'recently, pre-trained transformer based language models such as bert and gpt, have shown great improvement in many natural language processing (nlp) tasks. however, these models contain a large amount of parameters. the emergence of even larger and more accurate models such as gpt2 and megatron, suggest a trend of large pre-trained transformer models. however, using these large models in production environments is a complex task requiring a large amount of compute, memory and power resources. in this work we show how to perform quantization-aware training during the fine-tuning phase of bert in order to compress bert by $4\\\\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. furthermore, the produced quantized model can accelerate inference speed if it is optimized for 8bit integer supporting hardware.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'massive multiple-input multiple-output (mimo) radar, enabled by millimeter-wave virtual mimo techniques, provides great promises to the high-resolution automotive sensing and target detection in unmanned ground/aerial vehicles (uga/uav). as a long-established problem, however, existing subspace methods suffer from either high complexity or low accuracy. in this work, we propose two efficient methods, to accomplish fast subspace computation and accurate angle of arrival (aoa) acquisition. by leveraging randomized low-rank approximation, our fast multiple signal classification (music) methods, relying on random sampling and projection techniques, substantially accelerate the subspace estimation by orders of magnitude. moreover, we establish the theoretical bounds of our proposed methods, which ensure the accuracy of the approximated pseudo-spectrum. as demonstrated, the pseudo-spectrum acquired by our fast-music would be highly precise; and the estimated aoa is almost as accurate as standard music. in contrast, our new methods are tremendously faster than standard music. thus, our fast-music enables the high-resolution real-time environmental sensing with massive mimo radars, which has great potential in the emerging unmanned systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'deep learning has achieved great success in many applications. however, its deployment in practice has been hurdled by two issues: the privacy of data that has to be aggregated centrally for model training and high communication overhead due to transmission of a large amount of data usually geographically distributed. addressing both issues is challenging and most existing works could not provide an efficient solution. in this paper, we develop fedpc, a federated deep learning framework for privacy preservation and communication efficiency. the framework allows a model to be learned on multiple private datasets while not revealing any information of training data, even with intermediate data. the framework also minimizes the amount of data exchanged to update the model. we formally prove the convergence of the learning model when training with fedpc and its privacy-preserving property. we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of fedpc in terms of the approximation to the upper-bound performance (when training centrally) and communication overhead. the results show that fedpc maintains the performance approximation of the models within $8.5\\\\%$ of the centrally-trained models when data is distributed to 10 computing nodes. fedpc also reduces the communication overhead by up to $42.20\\\\%$ compared to existing works.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in interactive theorem provers (itps), extensible syntax is not only crucial to lower the cognitive burden of manipulating complex mathematical objects, but plays a critical role in developing reusable abstractions in libraries. most itps support such extensions in the form of restrictive \"syntax sugar\" substitutions and other ad hoc mechanisms, which are too rudimentary to support many desirable abstractions. as a result, libraries are littered with unnecessary redundancy. tactic languages in these systems are plagued by a seemingly unrelated issue: accidental name capture, which often produces unexpected and counterintuitive behavior. we take ideas from the scheme family of programming languages and solve these two problems simultaneously by proposing a novel hygienic macro system custom-built for itps. we further describe how our approach can be extended to cover type-directed macro expansion resulting in a single, uniform system offering multiple abstraction levels that range from supporting simplest syntax sugars to elaboration of formerly baked-in syntax. we have implemented our new macro system and integrated it into the new version of the lean theorem prover, lean 4. despite its expressivity, the macro system is simple enough that it can easily be integrated into other systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"forecasting pedestrian trajectories in dynamic scenes remains a critical problem in various applications, such as autonomous driving and socially aware robots. such forecasting is challenging due to human-human and human-object interactions and future uncertainties caused by human randomness. generative model-based methods handle future uncertainties by sampling a latent variable. however, few studies explored the generation of the latent variable. in this work, we propose the trajectory predictor with pseudo oracle (tppo), which is a generative model-based trajectory predictor. the first pseudo oracle is pedestrians' moving directions, and the second one is the latent variable estimated from ground truth trajectories. a social attention module is used to aggregate neighbors' interactions based on the correlation between pedestrians' moving directions and future trajectories. this correlation is inspired by the fact that pedestrians' future trajectories are often influenced by pedestrians in front. a latent variable predictor is proposed to estimate latent variable distributions from observed and ground-truth trajectories. moreover, the gap between these two distributions is minimized during training. therefore, the latent variable predictor can estimate the latent variable from observed trajectories to approximate that estimated from ground-truth trajectories. we compare the performance of tppo with related methods on several public datasets. results demonstrate that tppo outperforms state-of-the-art methods with low average and final displacement errors. the ablation study shows that the prediction performance will not dramatically decrease as sampling times decline during tests.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"the idea of slicing divergences has been proven to be successful when comparing two probability measures in various machine learning applications including generative modeling, and consists in computing the expected value of a `base divergence' between one-dimensional random projections of the two measures. however, the topological, statistical, and computational consequences of this technique have not yet been well-established. in this paper, we aim at bridging this gap and derive various theoretical properties of sliced probability divergences. first, we show that slicing preserves the metric axioms and the weak continuity of the divergence, implying that the sliced divergence will share similar topological properties. we then precise the results in the case where the base divergence belongs to the class of integral probability metrics. on the other hand, we establish that, under mild conditions, the sample complexity of a sliced divergence does not depend on the problem dimension. we finally apply our general results to several base divergences, and illustrate our theory on both synthetic and real data experiments.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'reinforcement learning agents learn by encouraging behaviours which maximize their total reward, usually provided by the environment. in many environments, however, the reward is provided after a series of actions rather than each single action, leading the agent to experience ambiguity in terms of whether those actions are effective, an issue known as the credit assignment problem. in this paper, we propose two strategies inspired by behavioural psychology to enable the agent to intrinsically estimate more informative reward values for actions with no reward. the first strategy, called self-punishment (sp), discourages the agent from making mistakes that lead to undesirable terminal states. the second strategy, called the rewards backfill (rb), backpropagates the rewards between two rewarded actions. we prove that, under certain assumptions and regardless of the reinforcement learning algorithm used, these two strategies maintain the order of policies in the space of all possible policies in terms of their total reward, and, by extension, maintain the optimal policy. hence, our proposed strategies integrate with any reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a value or action-value function through experience. we incorporated these two strategies into three popular deep reinforcement learning approaches and evaluated the results on thirty atari games. after parameter tuning, our results indicate that the proposed strategies improve the tested methods in over 65 percent of tested games by up to over 25 times performance improvement.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the defected ground structure (dgs) technique enables miniaturization of the resonator which leads to the development of the compact near-field wireless power transfer (wpt) systems. in general, numerous challenges are inherent in the design of the dgs-based wpt systems and, hence, appropriate trade-offs for achieving optimal performance are required. furthermore, the design advancements have led to the development of the dgs-based multi-band wpt systems to fulfill the needs of simultaneous data and power transfer. the innovations in the dgs-based wpt systems have also resulted in the definition of more commonly used figures-of-merit for the benchmarking of various performance metrics. the literature is replete with the design schemes to address one or more associated design challenges and successful wpt system realizations with enhanced performance. with this in mind, this paper touches upon the dgs-based wpts developments and presents a concise report on the current state-of-the-art and future directions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper presents channel-aware adversarial attacks against deep learning-based wireless signal classifiers. there is a transmitter that transmits signals with different modulation types. a deep neural network is used at each receiver to classify its over-the-air received signals to modulation types. in the meantime, an adversary transmits an adversarial perturbation (subject to a power budget) to fool receivers into making errors in classifying signals that are received as superpositions of transmitted signals and adversarial perturbations. first, these evasion attacks are shown to fail when channels are not considered in designing adversarial perturbations. then, realistic attacks are presented by considering channel effects from the adversary to each receiver. after showing that a channel-aware attack is selective (i.e., it affects only the receiver whose channel is considered in the perturbation design), a broadcast adversarial attack is presented by crafting a common adversarial perturbation to simultaneously fool classifiers at different receivers. the major vulnerability of modulation classifiers to over-the-air adversarial attacks is shown by accounting for different levels of information available about the channel, the transmitter input, and the classifier model. finally, a certified defense based on randomized smoothing that augments training data with noise is introduced to make the modulation classifier robust to adversarial perturbations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'a novel evolutionary approach for explainable artificial intelligence is presented: the \"evolved explanations\" model (evex). this methodology consists in combining local interpretable model agnostic explanations (lime) with multi-objective genetic algorithms to allow for automated segmentation parameter tuning in image classification tasks. in this case, the dataset studied is patch-camelyon, comprised of patches from pathology whole slide images. a publicly available convolutional neural network (cnn) was trained on this dataset to provide a binary classification for presence/absence of lymph node metastatic tissue. in turn, the classifications are explained by means of evolving segmentations, seeking to optimize three evaluation goals simultaneously. the final explanation is computed as the mean of all explanations generated by pareto front individuals, evolved by the developed genetic algorithm. to enhance reproducibility and traceability of the explanations, each of them was generated from several different seeds, randomly chosen. the observed results show remarkable agreement between different seeds. despite the stochastic nature of lime explanations, regions of high explanation weights proved to have good agreement in the heat maps, as computed by pixel-wise relative standard deviations. the found heat maps coincide with expert medical segmentations, which demonstrates that this methodology can find high quality explanations (according to the evaluation metrics), with the novel advantage of automated parameter fine tuning. these results give additional insight into the inner workings of neural network black box decision making for medical data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in sequence-to-sequence learning, e.g., natural language generation, the decoder relies on the attention mechanism to efficiently extract information from the encoder. while it is common practice to draw information from only the last encoder layer, recent work has proposed to use representations from different encoder layers for diversified levels of information. nonetheless, the decoder still obtains only a single view of the source sequences, which might lead to insufficient training of the encoder layer stack due to the hierarchy bypassing problem. in this work, we propose layer-wise multi-view decoding, where for each decoder layer, together with the representations from the last encoder layer, which serve as a global view, those from other encoder layers are supplemented for a stereoscopic view of the source sequences. systematic experiments and analyses show that we successfully address the hierarchy bypassing problem, require almost negligible parameter increase, and substantially improve the performance of sequence-to-sequence learning with deep representations on five diverse tasks, i.e., machine translation, abstractive summarization, image captioning, video captioning, and medical report generation. in particular, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on eight benchmark datasets, including a low-resource machine translation dataset and two low-resource medical report generation datasets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this work, we analyze an unfitted discontinuous galerkin discretization for the numerical solution of the stokes system based on equal higher-order discontinuous velocities and pressures. this approach combines the best from both worlds, firstly the advantages of a piece-wise discontinuous high-order accurate approximation and secondly the advantages of an unfitted to the true geometry grid around possibly complex objects and/or geometrical deformations. utilizing a fictitious domain framework, the physical domain of interest is embedded in an unfitted background mesh and the geometrically unfitted discretization is built upon symmetric interior penalty discontinuous galerkin formulation. to enhance stability we enrich the discrete variational formulation with a pressure stabilization term. moreover, the present contribution adopts high order ghost penalty strategies to address the ill conditioning of the system matrix caused by small truncated elements with respect to the unfitted boundary. motivated by continuous unfitted fem [21,74,75] along with other unfitted mesh surveys grounded on discontinuous spaces [10,44,45,73], we use proper velocity and pressure ghost penalties defined on faces of cut cells to establish a robust high-order method, in spite of the cell agglomeration technique usually applied on dg methods. the current presentation should prove valuable in engineering applications where special emphasis is placed on the optimal effective approximation attaining much smaller relative errors in coarser meshes. inf-sup stability, the optimal order of convergence, and the condition number sensitivity with respect to cut configuration are investigated. numerical examples verify the theoretical results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'disentanglement is a useful property in representation learning which increases the interpretability of generative models such as variational auto-encoders (vae), generative adversarial models, and their many variants. typically in such models, an increase in disentanglement performance is traded-off with generation quality. in the context of latent space models, this work presents a representation learning framework that explicitly promotes disentanglement by encouraging orthogonal directions of variations. the proposed objective is the sum of an auto-encoder error term along with a principal component analysis reconstruction error in the feature space. this has an interpretation of a restricted kernel machine with the eigenvector matrix valued on the stiefel manifold. our analysis shows that such a construction promotes disentanglement by matching the principal directions in the latent space with the directions of orthogonal variation in data space. in an alternating minimization scheme, we use cayley adam algorithm -- a stochastic optimization method on the stiefel manifold along with the adam optimizer. our theoretical discussion and various experiments show that the proposed model improves over many vae variants in terms of both generation quality and disentangled representation learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"in systems involving quantitative data, such as probabilistic, fuzzy, or metric systems, behavioural distances provide a more fine-grained comparison of states than two-valued notions of behavioural equivalence or behaviour inclusion. like in the two-valued case, the wide variation found in system types creates a need for generic methods that apply to many system types at once. approaches of this kind are emerging within the paradigm of universal coalgebra, based either on lifting pseudometrics along set functors or on lifting general real-valued (fuzzy) relations along functors by means of fuzzy lax extensions. an immediate benefit of the latter is that they allow bounding behavioural distance by means of fuzzy (bi-)simulations that need not themselves be hemi- or pseudometrics; this is analogous to classical simulations and bisimulations, which need not be preorders or equivalence relations, respectively. the known generic pseudometric liftings, specifically the generic kantorovich and wasserstein liftings, both can be extended to yield fuzzy lax extensions, using the fact that both are effectively given by a choice of quantitative modalities. our central result then shows that in fact all fuzzy lax extensions are kantorovich extensions for a suitable set of quantitative modalities, the so-called moss modalities. for nonexpansive fuzzy lax extensions, this allows for the extraction of quantitative modal logics that characterize behavioural distance, i.e. satisfy a quantitative version of the hennessy-milner theorem; equivalently, we obtain expressiveness of a quantitative version of moss' coalgebraic logic. all our results explicitly hold also for asymmetric distances (hemimetrics), i.e. notions of quantitative simulation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper studies optimal motion planning subject to motion and environment uncertainties. by modeling the system as a probabilistic labeled markov decision process (pl-mdp), the control objective is to synthesize a finite-memory policy, under which the agent satisfies complex high-level tasks expressed as linear temporal logic (ltl) with desired satisfaction probability. in particular, the cost optimization of the trajectory that satisfies infinite horizon tasks is considered, and the trade-off between reducing the expected mean cost and maximizing the probability of task satisfaction is analyzed. instead of using traditional rabin automata, the ltl formulas are converted to limit-deterministic b\\\\\"uchi automata (ldba) with a reachability acceptance condition and a compact graph structure. the novelty of this work lies in considering the cases where ltl specifications can be potentially infeasible and developing a relaxed product mdp between pl-mdp and ldba. the relaxed product mdp allows the agent to revise its motion plan whenever the task is not fully feasible and quantify the revised plan\\'s violation measurement. a multi-objective optimization problem is then formulated to jointly consider the probability of task satisfaction, the violation with respect to original task constraints, and the implementation cost of the policy execution. the formulated problem can be solved via coupled linear programs. to the best of our knowledge, this work first bridges the gap between probabilistic planning revision of potential infeasible ltl specifications and optimal control synthesis of both plan prefix and plan suffix of the trajectory over the infinite horizons. experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"dynamic objects have a significant impact on the robot's perception of the environment which degrades the performance of essential tasks such as localization and mapping. in this work, we address this problem by synthesizing plausible color, texture and geometry in regions occluded by dynamic objects. we propose the novel geometry-aware dynafill architecture that follows a coarse-to-fine topology and incorporates our gated recurrent feedback mechanism to adaptively fuse information from previous timesteps. we optimize our architecture using adversarial training to synthesize fine realistic textures which enables it to hallucinate color and depth structure in occluded regions online in a spatially and temporally coherent manner, without relying on future frame information. casting our inpainting problem as an image-to-image translation task, our model also corrects regions correlated with the presence of dynamic objects in the scene, such as shadows or reflections. we introduce a large-scale hyperrealistic dataset with rgb-d images, semantic segmentation labels, camera poses as well as groundtruth rgb-d information of occluded regions. extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in challenging weather conditions. furthermore, we present results for retrieval-based visual localization with the synthesized images that demonstrate the utility of our approach.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'accurate and efficient prediction of soft tissue temperatures is essential to computer-assisted treatment systems for thermal ablation. it can be used to predict tissue temperatures and ablation volumes for personalised treatment planning and image-guided intervention. numerically, it requires full nonlinear modelling of the coupled computational bioheat transfer and biomechanics, and efficient solution procedures; however, existing studies considered the bioheat analysis alone or the coupled linear analysis, without the fully coupled nonlinear analysis. we present a coupled thermo-visco-hyperelastic finite element algorithm, based on finite-strain thermoelasticity and total lagrangian explicit dynamics. it considers the coupled nonlinear analysis of (i) bioheat transfer under soft tissue deformations and (ii) soft tissue deformations due to thermal expansion/shrinkage. the presented method accounts for anisotropic, finite-strain, temperature-dependent, thermal, and viscoelastic behaviours of soft tissues, and it is implemented using gpu acceleration for real-time computation. we also demonstrate the translational benefits of the presented method for clinical applications using a simulation of thermal ablation in the liver. the key advantage of the presented method is that it enables full nonlinear modelling of the anisotropic, finite-strain, temperature-dependent, thermal, and viscoelastic behaviours of soft tissues, instead of linear elastic, linear viscoelastic, and thermal-only modelling in the existing methods. it also provides high computational speeds for computer-assisted treatment systems towards enabling the operator to simulate thermal ablation accurately and visualise tissue temperatures and ablation zones immediately.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"the effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. the reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight. in this paper, we propose to mine twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people's work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. the model is tested on freeway networks in pittsburgh as experiments. the resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. we find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. the occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. besides, people's tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. we make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as late as the midnight prior to the morning. the pittsburgh study supports that our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation. our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'to enhance image compression performance, recent deep neural network-based research can be divided into three categories: a learnable codec, a postprocessing network, and a compact representation network. the learnable codec has been designed for an end-to-end learning beyond the conventional compression modules. the postprocessing network increases the quality of decoded images using an example-based learning. the compact representation network is learned to reduce the capacity of an input image to reduce the bitrate while keeping the quality of the decoded image. however, these approaches are not compatible with the existing codecs or not optimal to increase the coding efficiency. specifically, it is difficult to achieve optimal learning in the previous studies using the compact representation network, due to the inaccurate consideration of the codecs. in this paper, we propose a novel standard compatible image compression framework based on auxiliary codec networks (acns). acns are designed to imitate image degradation operations of the existing codec, which delivers more accurate gradients to the compact representation network. therefore, the compact representation and the postprocessing networks can be learned effectively and optimally. we demonstrate that our proposed framework based on jpeg and high efficiency video coding (hevc) standard substantially outperforms existing image compression algorithms in a standard compatible manner.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'undersampling the k-space during mr acquisitions saves time, however results in an ill-posed inversion problem, leading to an infinite set of images as possible solutions. traditionally, this is tackled as a reconstruction problem by searching for a single \"best\" image out of this solution set according to some chosen regularization or prior. this approach, however, misses the possibility of other solutions and hence ignores the uncertainty in the inversion process. in this paper, we propose a method that instead returns multiple images which are possible under the acquisition model and the chosen prior to capture the uncertainty in the inversion process. to this end, we introduce a low dimensional latent space and model the posterior distribution of the latent vectors given the acquisition data in k-space, from which we can sample in the latent space and obtain the corresponding images. we use a variational autoencoder for the latent model and the metropolis adjusted langevin algorithm for the sampling. we evaluate our method on two datasets; with images from the human connectome project and in-house measured multi-coil images. we compare to five alternative methods. results indicate that the proposed method produces images that match the measured k-space data better than the alternatives, while showing realistic structural variability. furthermore, in contrast to the compared methods, the proposed method yields higher uncertainty in the undersampled phase encoding direction, as expected.   keywords: magnetic resonance image reconstruction, uncertainty estimation, inverse problems, sampling, mcmc, deep learning, unsupervised learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"in multiagent systems, the complex interaction of fixed incentives can lead agents to outcomes that are poor (inefficient) not only for the group, but also for each individual. price of anarchy is a technical, game-theoretic definition that quantifies the inefficiency arising in these scenarios -- it compares the welfare that can be achieved through perfect coordination against that achieved by self-interested agents at a nash equilibrium. we derive a differentiable, upper bound on a price of anarchy that agents can cheaply estimate during learning. equipped with this estimator, agents can adjust their incentives in a way that improves the efficiency incurred at a nash equilibrium. agents do so by learning to mix their reward (equiv. negative loss) with that of other agents by following the gradient of our derived upper bound. we refer to this approach as d3c. in the case where agent incentives are differentiable, d3c resembles the celebrated win-stay, lose-shift strategy from behavioral game theory, thereby establishing a connection between the global goal of maximum welfare and an established agent-centric learning rule. in the non-differentiable setting, as is common in multiagent reinforcement learning, we show the upper bound can be reduced via evolutionary strategies, until a compromise is reached in a distributed fashion. we demonstrate that d3c improves outcomes for each agent and the group as a whole on several social dilemmas including a traffic network exhibiting braess's paradox, a prisoner's dilemma, and several multiagent domains.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the number of parameters in state of the art neural networks has drastically increased in recent years. this surge of interest in large scale neural networks has motivated the development of new distributed training strategies enabling such models. one such strategy is model-parallel distributed training. unfortunately, model-parallelism suffers from poor resource utilisation, which leads to wasted resources. in this work, we improve upon recent developments in an idealised model-parallel optimisation setting: local learning. motivated by poor resource utilisation, we introduce a class of intermediary strategies between local and global learning referred to as interlocking backpropagation. these strategies preserve many of the compute-efficiency advantages of local optimisation, while recovering much of the task performance achieved by global optimisation. we assess our strategies on both image classification resnets and transformer language models, finding that our strategy consistently out-performs local learning in terms of task performance, and out-performs global learning in training efficiency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"bidirectional motion planning approaches decrease planning time, on average, compared to their unidirectional counterparts. in single-query feasible motion planning, using bidirectional search to find a continuous motion plan requires an edge connection between the forward and reverse search trees. such a tree-tree connection requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (bvp). however, a two-point bvp solution can be difficult or impossible to calculate for many systems. we present a novel bidirectional search strategy that does not require solving the two-point bvp. instead of connecting the forward and reverse trees directly, the reverse tree's cost information is used as a guiding heuristic for the forward search. this enables the forward search to quickly converge to a feasible solution without solving the two-point bvp. we propose two new algorithms (gbrrt and gabrrt) that use this strategy and run multiple software simulations using multiple dynamical systems and real-world hardware experiments to show that our algorithms perform on-par or better than existing state-of-the-art methods in quickly finding an initial feasible solution.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we propose the differentiable channel sparsity search (dcss) for convolutional neural networks. unlike traditional channel pruning algorithms which require users to manually set prune ratios for each convolutional layer, dcss automatically searches the optimal combination of sparsities. inspired by the differentiable architecture search (darts), we draw lessons from the continuous relaxation and leverage the gradient information to balance the computational cost and metrics. since directly applying the scheme of darts causes shape mismatching and excessive memory consumption, we introduce a novel technique called weight sharing within filters. this technique elegantly eliminates the problem of shape mismatching with negligible additional resources. we conduct comprehensive experiments on not only image classification but also find-grained tasks including semantic segmentation and image super resolution to verify the effectiveness of dcss. compared with previous network pruning approaches, dcss achieves state-of-the-art results for image classification. experimental results of semantic segmentation and image super resolution indicate that task-specific search achieves better performance than transferring slim models, demonstrating the wide applicability and high efficiency of dcss.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'since the beginning of the covid-19 spreading, the number of studies on the epidemic models increased dramatically. it is important for policymakers to know how the disease will spread and what are the effects of the policies and environment on the spreading. in this paper, we propose two extensions to the standard sir model: (a) we consider the prevention measures adopted based on the current severity of the infection. those measures are adaptive and change over time; (b) multiple cities and regions are considered, with population movements between those cities and regions, while taking into account that each region may have different prevention measures. although the adaptive measures and mobility of the population were often observed during the pandemic, these effects are rarely explicitly modeled and studied in the classical epidemic models. the model we propose gives rise to a plateau phenomenon: the number of people infected by the disease stays at the same level during an extended period of time. we show what are conditions need to be met in order for the spreading to exhibit a plateau period in a single city. in addition, this phenomenon is interdependent when considering multiple cities. we verify from the real-world data that the plateau phenomenon does exist in many regions of the world in the current covid-19 development. finally, we provide theoretical analysis on the plateau phenomenon for the single-city model and derive a series of results on the emergence and the ending of the plateau, as well as on the height and length of the plateau. our theoretical results match well with our experimental findings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'asynchronous programming models (apm) are gaining more and more traction, allowing applications to expose the available concurrency to a runtime system tasked with coordinating the execution. while mpi has long provided support for multi-threaded communication and non-blocking operations, it falls short of adequately supporting apms as correctly and efficiently handling mpi communication in different models is still a challenge. meanwhile, new low-level implementations of light-weight, cooperatively scheduled execution contexts (fibers, aka user-level threads (ult)) are meant to serve as a basis for higher-level apms and their integration in mpi implementations has been proposed as a replacement for traditional posix thread support to alleviate these challenges.   in this paper, we first establish a taxonomy in an attempt to clearly distinguish different concepts in the parallel software stack. we argue that the proposed tight integration of fiber implementations with mpi is neither warranted nor beneficial and instead is detrimental to the goal of mpi being a portable communication abstraction. we propose mpi continuations as an extension to the mpi standard to provide callback-based notifications on completed operations, leading to a clear separation of concerns by providing a loose coupling mechanism between mpi and apms. we show that this interface is flexible and interacts well with different apms, namely openmp detached tasks, ompss-2, and argobots.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'recent years have witnessed a flurry of research activity in graph matching, which aims at finding the correspondence of nodes across two graphs and lies at the heart of many artificial intelligence applications. however, matching heterogeneous graphs with partial overlap remains a challenging problem in real-world applications. this paper proposes the first practical learning-to-match method to meet this challenge. the proposed unsupervised method adopts a novel partial ot paradigm to learn a transport plan and node embeddings simultaneously. in a from-one-to-all manner, the entire learning procedure is decomposed into a series of easy-to-solve sub-procedures, each of which only handles the alignment of a single type of nodes. a mechanism for searching the transport mass is also proposed. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph matching methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'counterfactual regret minimization (cfr) has achieved many fascinating results in solving large-scale imperfect information games (iigs). neural network approximation cfr (neural cfr) is one of the promising techniques that can reduce computation and memory consumption by generalizing decision information between similar states. current neural cfr algorithms have to approximate cumulative regrets. however, efficient and accurate approximation in a large-scale iig is still a tough challenge. in this paper, a new cfr variant, recursive cfr (recfr), is proposed. in recfr, recursive substitute values (rsvs) are learned and used to replace cumulative regrets. it is proven that recfr can converge to a nash equilibrium at a rate of $o(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{t}})$. based on recfr, a new model-free neural cfr with bootstrap learning, neural recfr-b, is proposed. due to the recursive and non-cumulative nature of rsvs, neural recfr-b has lower-variance training targets than other neural cfrs. experimental results show that neural recfr-b is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural cfr algorithms at a much lower training cost.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'approximate message passing (amp) is a low-cost iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-gaussian distributions. however, amp only applies to independent identically distributed (iid) transform matrices, but may become unreliable (e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. orthogonal/vector amp (oamp/vamp) was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices to handle this difficulty. however, the bayes-optimal oamp/vamp (bo-oamp/vamp) requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean square error (mmse) estimator. this limits the application of oamp/vamp to large-scale systems.   to solve the disadvantages of amp and bo-oamp/vamp, this paper proposes a memory amp (mamp) framework under an orthogonality principle, which guarantees the asymptotic iid gaussianity of estimation errors in mamp. we present an orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators to realize the required orthogonality for mamp. furthermore, we propose a bayes-optimal mamp (bo-mamp), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference suppression. the complexity of bo-mamp is comparable to amp. a state evolution is derived to asymptotically characterize the performance of bo-mamp. based on state evolution, the relaxation parameters and damping vector in bo-mamp are optimized. for all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, the state evolution of the optimized bo-mamp converges to the same fixed point as that of the high-complexity bo-oamp/vamp and is bayes-optimal if its state evolution has a unique fixed point. finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and accuracy of the theoretical results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"exploring the tremendous amount of data efficiently to make a decision, similar to answering a complicated question, is challenging with many real-world application scenarios. in this context, automatic summarization has substantial importance as it will provide the foundation for big data analytic. traditional summarization approaches optimize the system to produce a short static summary that fits all users that do not consider the subjectivity aspect of summarization, i.e., what is deemed valuable for different users, making these approaches impractical in real-world use cases. this paper proposes an interactive concept-based summarization model, called adaptive summaries, that helps users make their desired summary instead of producing a single inflexible summary. the system learns from users' provided information gradually while interacting with the system by giving feedback in an iterative loop. users can choose either reject or accept action for selecting a concept being included in the summary with the importance of that concept from users' perspectives and confidence level of their feedback. the proposed approach can guarantee interactive speed to keep the user engaged in the process. furthermore, it eliminates the need for reference summaries, which is a challenging issue for summarization tasks. evaluations show that adaptive summaries helps users make high-quality summaries based on their preferences by maximizing the user-desired content in the generated summaries.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this work, we develop practical user scheduling algorithms for downlink bursty traffic with emphasis on user fairness. in contrast to the conventional scheduling algorithms that either equally divides the transmission time slots among users or maximizing some ratios without physcial meanings, we propose to use the 5%-tile user data rate (5tudr) as the metric to evaluate user fairness. since it is difficult to directly optimize 5tudr, we first cast the problem into the stochastic game framework and subsequently propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (marl)-based algorithm to perform distributed optimization on the resource block group (rbg) allocation. furthermore, each marl agent is designed to take information measured by network counters from multiple network layers (e.g. channel quality indicator, buffer size) as the input states while the rbg allocation as action with a proposed reward function designed to maximize 5tudr. extensive simulation is performed to show that the proposed marl-based scheduler can achieve fair scheduling while maintaining good average network throughput as compared to conventional schedulers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the record-breaking performance of deep neural networks (dnns) comes with heavy parameterization, leading to external dynamic random-access memory (dram) for storage. the prohibitive energy of dram accesses makes it non-trivial to deploy dnn on resource-constrained devices, calling for minimizing the weight and data movements to improve the energy efficiency. we present smartdeal (sd), an algorithm framework to trade higher-cost memory storage/access for lower-cost computation, in order to aggressively boost the storage and energy efficiency, for both inference and training. the core of sd is a novel weight decomposition with structural constraints, carefully crafted to unleash the hardware efficiency potential. specifically, we decompose each weight tensor as the product of a small basis matrix and a large structurally sparse coefficient matrix whose non-zeros are quantized to power-of-2. the resulting sparse and quantized dnns enjoy greatly reduced energy for data movement and weight storage, incurring minimal overhead to recover the original weights thanks to the sparse bit-operations and cost-favorable computations. beyond inference, we take another leap to embrace energy-efficient training, introducing innovative techniques to address the unique roadblocks arising in training while preserving the sd structures. we also design a dedicated hardware accelerator to fully utilize the sd structure to improve the real energy efficiency and latency. we conduct experiments on both multiple tasks, models and datasets in different settings. results show that: 1) applied to inference, sd achieves up to 2.44x energy efficiency as evaluated via real hardware implementations; 2) applied to training, sd leads to 10.56x and 4.48x reduction in the storage and training energy, with negligible accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art training baselines. our source codes are available online.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we develop a compositional scheme for the construction of continuous approximations for interconnections of infinitely many discrete-time switched systems. an approximation (also known as abstraction) is itself a continuous-space system, which can be used as a replacement of the original (also known as concrete) system in a controller design process. having designed a controller for the abstract system, it is refined to a more detailed one for the concrete system. we use the notion of so-called simulation functions to quantify the mismatch between the original system and its approximation. in particular, each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one in the abstract network are related through a notion of local simulation functions. we show that if the local simulation functions satisfy certain small-gain type conditions developed for a network containing infinitely many subsystems, then the aggregation of the individual simulation functions provides an overall simulation function quantifying the error between the overall abstraction network and the concrete one. in addition, we show that our methodology results in a scale-free compositional approach for any finite-but-arbitrarily large networks obtained from truncation of an infinite network. we provide a systematic approach to construct local abstractions and simulation functions for networks of linear switched systems. the required conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities that can be efficiently computed. we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through an application to ac islanded microgirds.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this work considers variational bayesian inference as an inexpensive and scalable alternative to a fully bayesian approach in the context of sparsity-promoting priors. in particular, the priors considered arise from scale mixtures of normal distributions with a generalized inverse gaussian mixing distribution. this includes the variational bayesian lasso as an inexpensive and scalable alternative to the bayesian lasso introduced in [65]. it also includes a family of priors which more strongly promote sparsity. for linear models the method requires only the iterative solution of deterministic least squares problems. furthermore, for p unknown covariates the method can be implemented exactly online with a cost of $o(p^3)$ in computation and $o(p^2)$ in memory per iteration -- in other words, the cost per iteration is independent of n, and in principle infinite data can be considered. for large $p$ an approximation is able to achieve promising results for a cost of $o(p)$ per iteration, in both computation and memory. strategies for hyper-parameter tuning are also considered. the method is implemented for real and simulated data. it is shown that the performance in terms of variable selection and uncertainty quantification of the variational bayesian lasso can be comparable to the bayesian lasso for problems which are tractable with that method, and for a fraction of the cost. the present method comfortably handles $n = 65536$, $p = 131073$ on a laptop in less than 30 minutes, and $n = 10^5$, $p = 2.1 \\\\times 10^6$ overnight.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'deep neural networks (dnns) are notorious for making more mistakes for the classes that have substantially fewer samples than the others during training. such class imbalance is ubiquitous in clinical applications and very crucial to handle because the classes with fewer samples most often correspond to critical cases (e.g., cancer) where misclassifications can have severe consequences. not to miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high true positive rates (tprs) by setting a higher threshold, but this comes at the cost of very high false positive rates (fprs) for problems with class imbalance. existing methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this into account. we argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by emphasizing reducing fprs at high tprs for problems where misclassification of the positive, i.e. critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. to this end, we pose the training of a dnn for binary classification as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be used with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the roc curve (auc) through prioritizing fpr reduction at high tpr. we solve the resulting constrained optimization problem using an augmented lagrangian method (alm). going beyond binary, we also propose two possible extensions of the proposed constraint for multi-class classification problems. we present experimental results for image-based binary and multi-class classification applications using an in-house medical imaging dataset, cifar10, and cifar100. our results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the baselines in majority of the cases by attaining higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing the misclassification rate for the non-critical class samples.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied in both academic and industry. however, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. to solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning (automl) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and automl together, is gaining attention from the research community. therefore, we comprehensively survey automl on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (hpo) and neural architecture search (nas) for graph machine learning. we further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss autogl, the first dedicated open-source library for automl on graphs. in the end, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. this paper is the first systematic and comprehensive review of automated machine learning on graphs to the best of our knowledge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'cytoarchitecture describes the spatial organization of neuronal cells in the brain, including their arrangement into layers and columns with respect to cell density, orientation, or presence of certain cell types. it allows to segregate the brain into cortical areas and subcortical nuclei, links structure with connectivity and function, and provides a microstructural reference for human brain atlases. mapping boundaries between areas requires to scan histological sections at microscopic resolution. while recent high-throughput scanners allow to scan a complete human brain in the order of a year, it is practically impossible to delineate regions at the same pace using the established gold standard method. researchers have recently addressed cytoarchitectonic mapping of cortical regions with deep neural networks, relying on image patches from individual 2d sections for classification. however, the 3d context, which is needed to disambiguate complex or obliquely cut brain regions, is not taken into account. in this work, we combine 2d histology with 3d topology by reformulating the mapping task as a node classification problem on an approximate 3d midsurface mesh through the isocortex. we extract deep features from cortical patches in 2d histological sections which are descriptive of cytoarchitecture, and assign them to the corresponding nodes on the 3d mesh to construct a large attributed graph. by solving the brain mapping problem on this graph using graph neural networks, we obtain significantly improved classification results. the proposed framework lends itself nicely to integration of additional neuroanatomical priors for mapping.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'with the development of earth observation technology, massive amounts of remote sensing (rs) images are acquired. to find useful information from these images, cross-modal rs image-voice retrieval provides a new insight. this paper aims to study the task of rs image-voice retrieval so as to search effective information from massive amounts of rs data. existing methods for rs image-voice retrieval rely primarily on the pairwise relationship to narrow the heterogeneous semantic gap between images and voices. however, apart from the pairwise relationship included in the datasets, the intra-modality and non-paired inter-modality relationships should also be taken into account simultaneously, since the semantic consistency among non-paired representations plays an important role in the rs image-voice retrieval task. inspired by this, a semantics-consistent representation learning (scrl) method is proposed for rs image-voice retrieval. the main novelty is that the proposed method takes the pairwise, intra-modality, and non-paired inter-modality relationships into account simultaneously, thereby improving the semantic consistency of the learned representations for the rs image-voice retrieval. the proposed scrl method consists of two main steps: 1) semantics encoding and 2) semantics-consistent representation learning. firstly, an image encoding network is adopted to extract high-level image features with a transfer learning strategy, and a voice encoding network with dilated convolution is devised to obtain high-level voice features. secondly, a consistent representation space is conducted by modeling the three kinds of relationships to narrow the heterogeneous semantic gap and learn semantics-consistent representations across two modalities. extensive experimental results on three challenging rs image-voice datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'magnetic levitation positioning technology has attracted considerable research efforts and dedicated attention due to its extremely attractive features. the technology offers high-precision, contactless, dust/lubricant-free, multi-axis, and large-stroke positioning. in this work, we focus on the accurate and smooth tracking problem of a multi-axis magnetically levitated (maglev) planar positioning system for a specific s-curve reference trajectory. the floating characteristics and the multi-axis coupling make accurate identification of the system dynamics difficult, which lead to a challenge to design a high performance control system. here, the tracking task is achieved by a 2-degree of freedom (dof) controller consisting of a feedforward controller and a robust stabilizing feedback controller with a prescribed sparsity pattern. the approach proposed in this paper utilizes the basis of an h-infinity controller formulation and a suitably established convex inner approximation. particularly, a subset of robust stabilizable controllers with prescribed structural constraints is characterized in the parameter space, and so thus the re-formulated convex optimization problem can be easily solved by several powerful numerical algorithms and solvers. with this approach, the robust stability of the overall system is ensured with a satisfactory system performance despite the presence of parametric uncertainties. furthermore, experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"domain shift, the mismatch between training and testing data characteristics, causes significant degradation in the predictive performance in multi-source imaging scenarios. in medical imaging, the heterogeneity of population, scanners and acquisition protocols at different sites presents a significant domain shift challenge and has limited the widespread clinical adoption of machine learning models. harmonization methods which aim to learn a representation of data invariant to these differences are the prevalent tools to address domain shift, but they typically result in degradation of predictive accuracy. this paper takes a different perspective of the problem: we embrace this disharmony in data and design a simple but effective framework for tackling domain shift. the key idea, based on our theoretical arguments, is to build a pretrained classifier on the source data and adapt this model to new data. the classifier can be fine-tuned for intra-site domain adaptation. we can also tackle situations where we do not have access to ground-truth labels on target data; we show how one can use auxiliary tasks for adaptation; these tasks employ covariates such as age, gender and race which are easy to obtain but nevertheless correlated to the main task. we demonstrate substantial improvements in both intra-site domain adaptation and inter-site domain generalization on large-scale real-world 3d brain mri datasets for classifying alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"many current neural networks for medical imaging generalise poorly to data unseen during training. such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting easy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other potentially informative features. for example, indistinguishable differences in the sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the performance of the network significantly. all neural networks intended for clinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences in imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.   to address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling as an implicit bias mitigation method. spectral decoupling encourages the neural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks' unnormalised prediction scores with an l2 penalty, thus having no added computational costs.   we show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets with strong spurious correlations and increases networks' robustness for data distribution shifts. to validate our findings, we train networks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue slides and covid-19 in chest radiographs. networks trained with spectral decoupling achieve up to 9.5 percent point higher performance on external datasets.   our results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues associated with neural networks, and can be used to complement or replace computationally expensive explicit bias mitigation methods, such as stain normalization in histological images. we recommend using spectral decoupling as an implicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical use.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'intelligent reflecting surfaces (irss) are promising enablers for next-generation wireless communications due to their reconfigurability and high energy efficiency in improving poor propagation condition of channels, e.g., limited scattering environment. however, most existing works assumed full-rank channels requiring rich scatters, which may not be available in practice. to analyze the impact of rank-deficient channels and mitigate the ensued performance loss, we consider a large-scale irs-aided mimo system with statistical channel state information (csi), where the double-scattering channel is adopted to model rank deficiency. by leveraging random matrix theory (rmt), we first derive a deterministic approximation (da) of the ergodic rate with low computational complexity and prove the existence and uniqueness of the da parameters. then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm for maximizing the da with respect to phase shifts and signal covariance matrices. numerical results will show that the da is tight and our proposed method can effectively mitigate the performance loss induced by channel rank deficiency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mimo) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (ris) are two promising technologies for application to beyond-5g networks. this paper considers cell-free massive mimo systems with the assistance of an ris for enhancing the system performance under the presence of spatial correlation among the engineered scattering elements of the ris. distributed maximum-ratio processing is considered at the access points (aps). we introduce an aggregated channel estimation approach that provides sufficient information for data processing with the main benefit of reducing the overhead required for channel estimation. the considered system is studied by using asymptotic analysis which lets the number of aps and/or the number of ris elements grow large. a lower bound for the channel capacity is obtained for a finite number of aps and engineered scattering elements of the ris, and closed-form expressions for the uplink and downlink ergodic net throughput are formulated in terms of only the channel statistics. based on the obtained analytical frameworks, we unveil the impact of channel correlation, the number of ris elements, and the pilot contamination on the net throughput of each user. in addition, a simple control scheme for optimizing the configuration of the engineered scattering elements of the ris is proposed, which is shown to increase the channel estimation quality, and, hence, the system performance. numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system design and performance analysis. in particular, the performance benefits of using riss in cell-free massive mimo systems are confirmed, especially if the direct links between the aps and the users are of insufficient quality with high probability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"various approaches have been proposed for out-of-distribution (ood) detection by augmenting models, input examples, training sets, and optimization objectives. deviating from existing work, we have a simple hypothesis that standard off-the-shelf models may already contain sufficient information about the training set distribution which can be leveraged for reliable ood detection. our empirical study on validating this hypothesis, which measures the model activation's mean for ood and in-distribution (id) mini-batches, surprisingly finds that activation means of ood mini-batches consistently deviate more from those of the training data. in addition, training data's activation means can be computed offline efficiently or retrieved from batch normalization layers as a `free lunch'. based upon this observation, we propose a novel metric called neural mean discrepancy (nmd), which compares neural means of the input examples and training data. leveraging the simplicity of nmd, we propose an efficient ood detector that computes neural means by a standard forward pass followed by a lightweight classifier. extensive experiments show that nmd outperforms state-of-the-art ood approaches across multiple datasets and model architectures in terms of both detection accuracy and computational cost.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"distant metastases (dm) refer to the dissemination of tumors, usually, beyond the organ where the tumor originated. they are the leading cause of death in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas (stss). positron emission tomography-computed tomography (pet-ct) is regarded as the imaging modality of choice for the management of stss. it is difficult to determine from imaging studies which sts patients will develop metastases. 'radiomics' refers to the extraction and analysis of quantitative features from medical images and it has been employed to help identify such tumors. the state-of-the-art in radiomics is based on convolutional neural networks (cnns). most cnns are designed for single-modality imaging data (ct or pet alone) and do not exploit the information embedded in pet-ct where there is a combination of an anatomical and functional imaging modality. furthermore, most radiomic methods rely on manual input from imaging specialists for tumor delineation, definition and selection of radiomic features. this approach, however, may not be scalable to tumors with complex boundaries and where there are multiple other sites of disease. we outline a new 3d cnn to help predict dm in sts patients from pet-ct data. the 3d cnn uses a constrained feature learning module and a hierarchical multi-modality feature learning module that leverages the complementary information from the modalities to focus on semantically important regions. our results on a public pet-ct dataset of sts patients show that multi-modal information improves the ability to identify those patients who develop dm. further our method outperformed all other related state-of-the-art methods.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'small target motion detection within complex natural environments is an extremely challenging task for autonomous robots. surprisingly, the visual systems of insects have evolved to be highly efficient in detecting mates and tracking prey, even though targets occupy as small as a few degrees of their visual fields. the excellent sensitivity to small target motion relies on a class of specialized neurons called small target motion detectors (stmds). however, existing stmd-based models are heavily dependent on visual contrast and perform poorly in complex natural environments where small targets generally exhibit extremely low contrast against neighbouring backgrounds. in this paper, we develop an attention and prediction guided visual system to overcome this limitation. the developed visual system comprises three main subsystems, namely, an attention module, an stmd-based neural network, and a prediction module. the attention module searches for potential small targets in the predicted areas of the input image and enhances their contrast against complex background. the stmd-based neural network receives the contrast-enhanced image and discriminates small moving targets from background false positives. the prediction module foresees future positions of the detected targets and generates a prediction map for the attention module. the three subsystems are connected in a recurrent architecture allowing information to be processed sequentially to activate specific areas for small target detection. extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed visual system for detecting small, low-contrast moving targets against complex natural environments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we present a novel finite element analysis of inelastic structures containing shape memory alloys (smas). phenomenological constitutive models for smas lead to material nonlinearities, that require substantial computational effort to resolve. finite element analysis methods, which rely on gauss quadrature integration schemes, must solve two sets of coupled differential equations: one at the global level and the other at the local, i.e. gauss point level. in contrast to the conventional return mapping algorithm, which solves these two sets of coupled differential equations separately using a nested newton procedure, we propose a scheme to solve the local and global differential equations simultaneously. in the process we also derive closed-form expressions used to update the internal/constitutive state variables, and unify the popular closest-point and cutting plane methods with our formulas. numerical testing indicates that our method allows for larger thermomechanical loading steps and provides increased computational efficiency, over the standard return mapping algorithm.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'despite the rapid development and great success of machine learning models, extensive studies have exposed their disadvantage of inheriting latent discrimination and societal bias from the training data. this phenomenon hinders their adoption on high-stake applications. thus, many efforts have been taken for developing fair machine learning models. most of them require that sensitive attributes are available during training to learn fair models. however, in many real-world applications, it is usually infeasible to obtain the sensitive attributes due to privacy or legal issues, which challenges existing fair-ensuring strategies. though the sensitive attribute of each data sample is unknown, we observe that there are usually some non-sensitive features in the training data that are highly correlated with sensitive attributes, which can be used to alleviate the bias. therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring features that are highly correlated with sensitive attributes for learning fair and accurate classifiers. we theoretically show that by minimizing the correlation between these related features and model prediction, we can learn a fair classifier. based on this motivation, we propose a novel framework which simultaneously uses these related features for accurate prediction and enforces fairness. in addition, the model can dynamically adjust the regularization weight of each related feature to balance its contribution on model classification and fairness. experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for learning fair models with high classification accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'clouds are a very important factor in the availability of optical remote sensing images. recently, deep learning-based cloud detection methods have surpassed classical methods based on rules and physical models of clouds. however, most of these deep models are very large which limits their applicability and explainability, while other models do not make use of the full spectral information in multi-spectral images such as sentinel-2. in this paper, we propose a lightweight network for cloud detection, fusing multi-scale spectral and spatial features (cdfm3sf) and tailored for processing all spectral bands in sentinel- 2a images. the proposed method consists of an encoder and a decoder. in the encoder, three input branches are designed to handle spectral bands at their native resolution and extract multiscale spectral features. three novel components are designed: a mixed depth-wise separable convolution (mdsc) and a shared and dilated residual block (sdrb) to extract multi-scale spatial features, and a concatenation and sum (cs) operation to fuse multi-scale spectral and spatial features with little calculation and no additional parameters. the decoder of cd-fm3sf outputs three cloud masks at the same resolution as input bands to enhance the supervision information of small, middle and large clouds. to validate the performance of the proposed method, we manually labeled 36 sentinel-2a scenes evenly distributed over mainland china. the experiment results demonstrate that cd-fm3sf outperforms traditional cloud detection methods and state-of-theart deep learning-based methods in both accuracy and speed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'quantum machine learning (qml) models based on parameterized quantum circuits are often highlighted as candidates for quantum computing\\'s near-term \"killer application\". however, the understanding of the empirical and generalization performance of these models is still in its infancy. in this paper, we study how to balance between training accuracy and generalization performance (also called structural risk minimization) for two prominent qml models introduced by havl\\\\\\'i\\\\v{c}ek et al. (nature, 2019), and schuld and killoran (prl, 2019). firstly, using relationships to well-understood classical models, we prove that two model parameters -- i.e., the dimension of the sum of the images and the frobenius norm of the observables used by the model -- closely control the models\\' complexity and therefore its generalization performance. secondly, using ideas inspired by process tomography, we prove that these model parameters also closely control the models\\' ability to capture correlations in sets of training examples. in summary, our results give rise to new options for structural risk minimization for qml models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we take a data-driven approach and apply machine learning to the moment closure problem for radiative transfer equation in slab geometry. instead of learning the unclosed high order moment, we propose to directly learn the gradient of the high order moment using neural networks. this new approach is consistent with the exact closure we derive for the free streaming limit and also provides a natural output normalization. a variety of benchmark tests, including the variable scattering problem, the gaussian source problem with both periodic and reflecting boundaries, and the two-material problem, show both good accuracy and generalizability of our machine learning closure model.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'previous cycle-consistency correspondence learning methods usually leverage image patches for training. in this paper, we present a fully convolutional method, which is simpler and more coherent to the inference process. while directly applying fully convolutional training results in model collapse, we study the underline reason behind this collapse phenomenon, indicating that the absolute positions of pixels provide a shortcut to easily accomplish cycle-consistence, which hinders the learning of meaningful visual representations. to break this absolute position shortcut, we propose to apply different crops for forward and backward frames, and adopt feature warping to establish correspondence between two crops of a same frame. the former technique enforces the corresponding pixels at forward and back tracks to have different absolute positions, and the latter effectively blocks the shortcuts going between forward and back tracks. in three label propagation benchmarks for pose tracking, face landmark tracking and video object segmentation, our method largely improves the results of vanilla fully convolutional cycle-consistency method, achieving very competitive performance compared with the self-supervised state-of-the-art approaches. our trained model and code are available at \\\\url{https://github.com/steve-tod/stfc3}.',\n",

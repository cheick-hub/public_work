Hello, my name is `Cheick FOFANA` and this is my personnal repo. You can find here some works that i have done (sometimes with my sidekick `Isaac NIVET`) in the past during my free time between school and my life as a ML engineer. I still have lot of works in the background on computer vision, cryptocurrencies and a lot of fun stuff...


This repo contains the following files/directories : 

- `Automatic_research_paper_clustering` : this directory contains all the necessary in order to automatically cluster new research papers from `arxiv.org`. The articles are scrapped, embedded, then clustered. Results are exposed on a local server. (Documentation in progress ðŸ˜…)

- `FOFANA_NIVET_dgl_presentation.ipynb` : this file show semi-supervised learning with a classification task on a knowledge graph(`Karate Club dataset`) by using a graph neural network.

- `Neural_MF.html` : this file contains a benchmark between three deep learning models on the task of infering users opinions(ratings). This is based on matrix factorisation in recommender systems on the well-know dataset `movielens`. (Interpretation in progress ðŸ˜…)

- `writed_by_me` : holds the papers I produced during my Master's degree, including `offline_reinforcement_learning.pdf` - my thesis on offline reinforcement learning, supervised by Phillipe PREUX (Head of Reinforcement Learning Lab at [INRIA](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00736322)), `memoire_Pymma_Software.pdf` - a detailed paper describing the encountered problems and proposed solutions during my apprenticeship, and `Optimisation_ORKAD.pdf` - a report created in the optimization lab [ORKAD](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/equipes/orkad/)  with the assistance of Laeticia Jourdan (Head of ORKAD Team) in my last year of Licence.
